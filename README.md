# Detecting Gallbladders using transformers
The aim of the project was to use pretrained Vission-Transformers VIT and to train them on a large dataset of gallbladder MRIs. We were able to successfully use the transformers on gallbladder classifiaction tasks with almost 90% accuracy. We have used different VITs for this purpose and tied to find out which one is the best.
